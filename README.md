# GooglePhotosDownloader
Google Photos used to have seamless integration with Google Drive, allowing users to access their photos directly from their file system. However, Google removed this feature, forcing users to manually download their photos via the Google Photos web interface.Many users, including myself, prefer to store their Google Photos locally on a NAS for backup and easy access. This script automates the entire process with just one click.
